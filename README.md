# Optimizing Urban Transit: Adaptive and Inclusive Seating Allocation Strategies

This project presents an innovative approach to urban transit by implementing a Smart Adaptive Seating Allocation System that enhances passenger comfort and safety. Leveraging priority queue algorithms and real-time sensor data, the system dynamically assigns seats based on passenger needs, including age, pregnancy status, and medical conditions, ensuring a more inclusive commuting experience. Additional considerations such as proximity to exits, ventilation, and reduced exposure to health risks further improve urban transit efficiency. By integrating these adaptive seating strategies, public transportation systems can enhance accessibility, manage crowds effectively, and promote a user-centric mobility model for modern urban environments.
